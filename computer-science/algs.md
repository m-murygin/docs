## Guiding Principles for Analysis of Algorithms

1. Use worst-case analysis
2. Do not pay much attention to constant factors, lower-order terms
    * it is way easier
    * constants depend on architecture/compiler/programmer anyway
    * lose very little predictive power
3. Use asymptocit analysis (focus on large input sizes)

**Fast Algorithm** - worst-case running time grows slowly with input size
