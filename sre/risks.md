# Managing Risks

## Risks definitions
1. Define all the SLO risks. The sources:
    * failures in the past could be a good source of data
    * analyzing all the possible hazards.
1. Priorize risk by the following equation:
    ```
    Risk = probability * impact
    ```

    * probability => time to failure
    * impact => service downtime
1. With the above convension we could measure risk as **Bad Minutes / Year**

## Dowtime
1. Consist of:
    * Time to detection
    * Time to resolution
    * Percentage of users impacted
