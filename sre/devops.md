# DevOps

## Core Values
1. *C*ulture
    * remove the wall between dev and ops
1. *A*utomation - automate everything, but put people over processes over tools.
    * Define how is responsible for job function
    * Put people first (like who is going to take over a task, then what kind of processes are we going to optimize and why do we need it, and only then think about the tools to implement task).
1. *M*easurement - measure key metrics across the organization during devops transformation.
    * MTTR
    * Cycle Time
    * Cost
    * Revenue
    * Employee satisfaction
1. *S*haring - feedback loop that helps continuously improve.


## Principles

1. *System thinking* - always think how your changes impact the whole system.

1. *Feedback Loop* - think how to improve feedback loop. Efficient feedback loop speeds up development a lot. The earlier in feedback loop we found a bug - the less expensive is to fix it.

1. *Continuous Experimentation* - focus on the creation of experimentation culture.
    * learning and applying new things and getting fast feedback on changes, instead of going into analysis paralysis.
    * better way to learn something is to try it, if we have an efficient tool chain for experimentation - we enforce this culture.
    * Working code wins.
