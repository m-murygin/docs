# General Demensions of Scalability

## Scaling Productivity Through Automation
1. Add Automated Tests
1. CI/CD
1. Monitoring / Alerting
1. Log Aggregation

## Scaling Yourself
1. Overtime is not a way to Scale!
    * by maintaining good work/life balance I stay happier, more productive and prevent burnout
1. Manage yourself like a project
    * Manage Scope - try to focus on what is really matter
    * Manage Cost - if it's cheaper to buy something, than to implement it yourself - just do it. Learn the science of delegation
    * Manage Schedule - try to influence the decisions about deadlines with considerable arguments based on data

## Scaling Agile Teams
1. It's antipattern to have teams based on functions (like QA team, front end team, backend team).
1. It's much better to have teams based on separated part of product
1. Maintain the amount of procedures and red tape that you have in the team. Every new rule comes with a cost of losing autonomy, flexibility and creativity.
1. Maintain Culture Alignment so that everybody goes in the same direction and knows his value in the success
