# Microservices

## Common
1. The goal is create fully isolated service. Which could and should be deployed independenly.
1. Do not start with microservices. Because getting bounded context wrong it's very expensive. So it's better to wait until thigs become stable
1. Health check for every service and for the whole system
1. Handle versioning of end points. Doing this we can release a new version of service **A** `v2`, but we should support `v1`. Then if we have service **B** which use some of the API of service **A**, we donâ€™t have to release new version of **B**, because **B** still can use version `v1`.
1. Use **expectation** tests. When service create expectation test for every of it's consumer.

## API
1. Use correct HTTP status codes
1. Use correct verbs for HTTP requests
1. Use one of the well-known style guide ([paypal](https://github.com/paypal/api-standards/blob/master/api-style-guide.md))
1. Use _Hypermedia AS the Engine of Application State_ to reduce coupling. It means send hyperlinks of next actions to a client.
1. Send with API only necessary fields, by doing this we can change our inner models more easyly


## Bounded Context
1. We should split bounded context according to a buissness goals, not according to a data models.
1. Share only necessay fields of shared models
