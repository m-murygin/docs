# HTML

## Common

1. There are two type of elements:
    * **block elements** - always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of the parent element (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    * **inline elements** - does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

2. In HTML all spaces and new lines turn into one single space
